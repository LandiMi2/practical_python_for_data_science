# head.py

Create a Python program called `head.py` that does the following:

* It should expect one or two arguments; if there are no arguments, print a "Usage" statement
* The first argument is required and much be a regular file; if it is not, print "<arg> is not a file" and exit *with an error code*
* The second argument is optional. If given, it must be a positive number (non-zero); if it is not, then print "lines (<arg>) must be a positive number". If no argument is provided, use a default value of 3. You can expect that the test will only give you a value that can be safely converted to a number using the `int` function.
* If given good input, it should act like the normal `head` utility and print the expected number of lines from the file

Expected behavior:

````
$ ./head.py
Usage: head.py FILE [NUM_LINES]
$ ./head.py foo
foo is not a file
$ ./head.py files/issa.txt

Don’t worry, spiders,
$ ./head.py files/issa.txt 5
